# Hack the Threat 2023





## Background:
During this competition, SFU and TACC participants will be presented with data challenges and problems within the scope of cybersecurity, environmental, and social threats. Participants will be able to choose their challenge of interest and form teams, working collaboratively to explore and develop solutions within a given time frame. Pre-event virtual training sessions will provide information on computational resources that will be made available to the participants. Data may be provided by team mentors, TACC or SFU researchers, or taken from public repositories. Participants will use Jupyter notebooks, Python, and other programming languages to address the hackathon goals. Teams will present their findings to a panel of judges and industry experts for final evaluation. Prizes will be awarded to the winning teams.
Students/Hackers include any student from University of Texas at Austin, Simon Fraser University, or University of British Columbia who are enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in data processes and analysis.
Mentors will "pitch" data challenges related to their field of research. If selected by the students/hackers, the mentor will then assist the team to scope, develop, and implement a solution to the challenge. A mentor and staff overview will be hosted prior to the hackathon event.
