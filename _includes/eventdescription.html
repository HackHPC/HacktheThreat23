The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) is partnering with Simon Fraser University (SFU) to offer an engaging virtual Hackathon 
from <strong>March 2<sup style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">nd</sup > - 6<sup style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">th</sup>, 2023</strong>. 
During this competition, participants will be presented with data challenges and problems within the scope of cybersecurity, environmental, and social threats. 
Participants will be able to choose their challenge of interest and form teams, working collaboratively to explore and develop solutions within a given time frame. 
Pre-event virtual training sessions will provide information on computational resources that will be made available to the participants. Data may be provided by 
team mentors, TACC or SFU researchers, or taken from public repositories. Participants will use Jupyter notebooks, Python, and other programming languages to address 
the hackathon goals. Teams will present their findings to a panel of judges and industry experts for final evaluation. Prizes will be awarded to the winning teams.
