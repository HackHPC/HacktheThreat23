    bio: >
      I’ve been a professor here at SFU in computing science since 1989, coming to the west coast after completing my PhD in Artificial 
      Intelligence and Cognitive Science at the University of Edinburgh. Although I have worked in a range of areas involving AI, much 
      of my research has involved applications of AI to real world problems, with my passion being in how computers can be used to process 
      human language. I’ve also spent time outside of the university with companies and organizations doing work in this area.
